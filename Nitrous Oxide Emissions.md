## Nitrous Oxide Emissions
## 1. Introduction
- Most of the N2O emissions take place in soils and are related with agricultural activities[@reayGlobalAgricultureNitrous2012].

- NItrous Oxide is primarily produced in soil by the activities of micro-organism during nitrification and denitrification processes.

- N2O reduced from Organic farming

- Data Description
    - N2O from FAO data
        - Agrifood systems = Farm Gate + Land Use Change + Emission on Agricultural Land + Pre- and Post- Production
        - Year: 2000-2020
        - Countries: 30 EU countries (Some are EU members and others)


- EU CAP - environment cross-compliant
- Organic --> Atmospheric Effect - Reduction of GHG
