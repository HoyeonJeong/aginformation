The requirements of the map are listed below. All the tasks required to fulfill this assignment are documented within this and previous modules.

## The Sunrise Gazette showcase map

A small but trendy newspaper is looking for a custom map for an upcoming special online edition. The editors have given you full control over the theme and design of the map. They have one exception, though. The map must be a Mapbox map built from a blank style. In the short time that you have, you must design a compelling map from scratch. Think about a unique topic, destination, festival, etc., that can inspire you to finish a map on deadline.

They want the map hosted on a web page that contains a little information about your selected topic. They request a picture (give appropriate credit) and a paragraph or two about your topic. Their writing staff will then research your topic and fill out the remaining content of the story.

## Required specifications of the deliverable

1) The Mapbox map must fulfill the following requirements:

> * Use at least four tilesets in your style.
> * Add at least two text label layers.

2) The client has requested that the Mapbox map be embedded in a web page with more information about the showcased landform. 

> * Modify the _lab-09/map/index.html_ file to include your topic's title, metadata, and social links (if appropriate).
> * This page must have (at least) one photograph and a short paragraph of your map's topic.
> * Modify the _lab-09/map/map.html_ file to include your custom map, including zoom level and center of map topic.
